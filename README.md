# BingAds-PHP-SDK

You can develop Bing Ads applications with any programming language that supports web services. The Bing Ads PHP Software Development Kit (SDK) enhances the experience of developing Bing Ads applications with the PHP programming language. The SDK includes a proxy to all Bing Ads API web services and abstracts low level details of authentication with OAuth. The SDK follows the PSR-4 standard to support autoloading classes from file paths, so that you donâ€™t have to include each classes manually. Your application can simply require autoload.php: `require_once "/../vendor/autoload.php";`
